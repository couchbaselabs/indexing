Manik's concern on the too much of data exchange between query and indexing.

  manik: " it seems to me that a lot of data can be potentially exchanged
  between the indexer nodes and the query engine. This is due to the fact that
  the protocol doesn't provide a mechanism to filter the scan at results on the
  indexer side.  For example if I am interested in only those people living a
  particular  city who are above the age of 10, assuming that the index has been
  created on the city name the indexer will  basically return the list of
  everyone living in that city.  It will be up to the query engine to do the
  filtering of the results. "

  Siri: " Yes - youâ€™re right. The query engine is the filter - so to realize what
  you suggest, one could co-locate the query and the index. In general,
  query is a stateless component, so it could redirect all or part of a
  query (with intermediate results) to any other node if it can execute more
  efficiently rather than fetching data.
  We are definitely treading new ground here. Keeping index, storage and
  query separate is new to me. So I really want a prototype to benchmark to
  figure out the bottlenecks. "
